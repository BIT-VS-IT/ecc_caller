### This is a temporary repository to show an example of the pipeline used to call eccDNA forming regions from eccDNA sequencing data in Magnaporthe oryzae
### This was written by Pierre Joubert of the Krasileva lab, Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, Berkeley, CA, USA
### These scripts are meant to serve as an example of what the pipeline looks like, they are not easily portable to new data
### If you are interested in using these for your data please email pierrj@berkeley.edu
